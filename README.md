# My Microsite

This repository hosts a simple microsite used to publish my newsletter. The landing page lists available newsletter issues.

* `index.html` â€“ landing page with a list of newsletters
* `vol1.html` â€“ first newsletter issue
* `vol2.html` â€“ education roadmap with a light-themed, interactive D3.js Sankey chart
